# Customer-Segmentation-for-Targeted-Marketing-in-Banking

This project focuses on applying K-Mode clustering to a dataset related to direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The dataset includes attributes such as customer age, job type, marital status, education, credit status, housing and personal loans, contact communication, last contact month, last contact day of the week, and the outcome of the previous marketing campaign. By leveraging K-Mode clustering, the bank aims to identify distinct customer segments based on these categorical attributes. This segmentation allows for more effective targeting of marketing campaigns and personalized communication strategies. The benefit lies in optimizing marketing efforts, enhancing customer engagement, and increasing the likelihood of customers subscribing to the bank services such as term deposits or insurances, ultimately improving the bank's marketing ROI and customer satisfaction.
